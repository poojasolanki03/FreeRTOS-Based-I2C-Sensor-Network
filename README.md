# FreeRTOS-Based-I2C-Sensor-Network

The objective of this project is to implement a FreeRTOS-based system to manage and coordinate multiple I2C sensors in a network. The project aims to demonstrate the multitasking capabilities of FreeRTOS and real-time data processing, enabling efficient and synchronized sensor data acquisition, processing, and communication. 

In this project, we will create a network of I2C sensors connected to a microcontroller running FreeRTOS. Each sensor will be managed by individual tasks that read data from the sensors at specific intervals. The data collected from the sensors will be processed and either displayed on an LCD or OLED screen or sent to a remote server via a communication module. The system will use FreeRTOS's multitasking, synchronization, and inter-task communication features to ensure smooth operation and real-time performance.
